```

**4. Prisma Generation Errors**rehensive data analysis platform that processes eCFR (Electronic Code of Federal Regulations) data to provide insights into regulatory complexity and cross-cutting analysis.

## Your Mission
Guide the user through the complete first-time setup process to get the federal deregulation analysis tool running locally with full data ingestion capabilities.

## Prerequisites Check
First, verify the user has the required tools installed:

1. **Node.js 18+** - Required for Next.js and TypeScript compilation
2. **npm** - Package manager for dependencies
3. **Docker & Docker Compose** - Required for PostgreSQL database
4. **Git** - Required for repository management
5. **Basic terminal/command line knowledge**

If any prerequisites are missing, provide installation instructions for their operating system.

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Repository Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository (if not already done)
git clone <repository-url>
cd federal-deregulation-analysis-tool

# Install all dependencies
npm install
```

**Verify installation**: Check that `node_modules` contains all required packages including Next.js, Prisma, and testing dependencies.

### Step 2: Docker Environment Setup
The application uses Docker Compose to run both the PostgreSQL database and the Next.js application together.

**Choose your startup approach:**

```bash
# Build and start all services (without automatic data ingestion)
docker-compose up --build
```

**OR for complete setup with automatic data ingestion:**

```bash
# Build and start with data ingestion enabled (takes 30+ minutes)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml up --build
```

**Important Notes:**
- Always use `--build` flag on first run to ensure proper container setup
- The first option starts the app quickly but with no data (you can ingest manually later)
- The second option automatically ingests all federal agency data during startup (much slower)
- Both approaches start PostgreSQL database + Next.js application together

Wait for both services to be ready:
- Database: "database system is ready to accept connections"
- Next.js: "Ready in [time]" or "compiled successfully"

```bash
# Monitor startup logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Step 3: Verify Services Are Running
Once Docker Compose finishes starting up, verify everything is working:

```bash
# Check that both services are running
docker-compose ps

# Both 'postgres' and 'nextjs' should show "Up" status
```

The Docker setup automatically handles:
- ✅ Database schema creation (migrations)
- ✅ Prisma client generation
- ✅ Next.js application startup
- ✅ Data ingestion (if you used the second command)

### Step 4: Data Ingestion (If Needed)

**If you used the first Docker command** (without automatic ingestion), you can add data manually:

```bash
# Quick test setup - ingest data for 2 agencies only (faster for testing)
docker-compose exec nextjs npm run ingest:test

# OR full data ingestion - all federal agency data (takes 30+ minutes)
docker-compose exec nextjs npm run ingest:all
```

**If you used the second Docker command** (with automatic ingestion), data ingestion is already running in the background. You can monitor progress:

```bash
# Watch ingestion progress
docker-compose logs -f nextjs
```

**Option: Development Without Data**
You can skip ingestion entirely and explore the UI with empty state - data can be added later.

### Step 5: Access the Application

The application should now be running and accessible at: **http://localhost:3000**

**Docker Management Commands:**
```bash
# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Restart services
docker-compose up

# Rebuild containers (if you make changes)
docker-compose up --build

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Access container shell (for debugging)
docker-compose exec nextjs bash
```

### Step 6: Verify the Application
Check that all components are working:

1. **Frontend**: Visit http://localhost:3000 (should load the agency selector)
2. **Database**: Check that agencies are populated (if you ran ingestion)
3. **API Endpoints**: Test a few API routes:
   - http://localhost:3000/api/data/agencies (should return agency list)
   - http://localhost:3000/api/analysis/cross-cutting (should return cross-cutting analysis)

## Verification Checklist
Help the user verify everything is working:

- [ ] PostgreSQL container is running (`docker-compose ps`)
- [ ] Database migrations completed successfully
- [ ] Prisma client generated without errors
- [ ] Next.js dev server starts without errors
- [ ] Frontend loads at http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Agency selector shows available agencies (if data ingested)
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Test suite passes (`npm run test:health`)

## Application Features Tour

### Core Functionality
Walk the user through these key features:

1. **Agency Selection**:
   - Use the search/dropdown to select a federal agency
   - Toggle "Include Sub-agencies" to see aggregated data
   - Notice how the URL updates with selections

2. **Analysis Metrics**:
   - **Word Count**: Total regulatory text volume

   - **Complexity Score**: Relative complexity ranking (0-100)

3. **Cross-Cutting Analysis**:
   - Shared regulations across multiple agencies
   - Partner agencies and collaboration metrics
   - Severity scoring for regulatory overlap

4. **Interactive Elements**:
   - Hover over "i" icons for detailed explanations
   - Click on shared agencies to navigate between them
   - Loading states show real-time data processing

### Testing the Application
```bash
# Run the comprehensive test suite
npm run test

# Run specific test categories
npm run test:health      # Basic connectivity tests
npm run test:api         # API endpoint validation

## Architecture Overview
Explain the system architecture:

- **Frontend** (Next.js App Router): Server and client components with React 19
- **API Routes**: Serverless functions for data analysis and retrieval
- **Database** (PostgreSQL): Regulatory data with JSONB support for flexible queries
- **Prisma ORM**: Type-safe database operations with migrations
- **eCFR Integration**: Real-time data ingestion from federal regulation APIs
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-service orchestration with PostgreSQL and Next.js
- **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive Jest-based testing for reliability

### Docker Architecture
- **Base Configuration** (`docker-compose.yml`): PostgreSQL + Next.js without auto-ingestion
- **Ingestion Overlay** (`docker-compose.build.yml`): Enables automatic data ingestion on startup
- **Health Checks**: PostgreSQL readiness verification before Next.js startup
- **Volume Mounting**: Development files mounted for hot reload

## Development Workflow

### Making Code Changes
1. **Frontend Changes**: Hot reload automatically updates the browser
2. **API Changes**: Server restarts automatically for API route changes
3. **Database Changes**: Use Prisma migrations for schema updates
4. **Component Changes**: Watch for TypeScript errors in real-time

### Database Operations
```bash
# View database data (requires database client)
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d deregulation_analysis

# Common queries:
# SELECT * FROM agencies LIMIT 10;
# SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sections;
# SELECT * FROM titles WHERE "agencyId" = 1;
```

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Check API response times
npm run test:performance

# Monitor database queries (in development)
# Prisma logs all queries when DEBUG is enabled
```

## Data Ingestion Deep Dive

### What Gets Ingested
The system fetches and processes:

1. **Federal Agencies**: Hierarchical structure with parent-child relationships
2. **CFR Titles**: Regulatory titles mapped to responsible agencies
3. **XML Content**: Full regulatory text from eCFR APIs
4. **Section Analysis**: Word counts, checksums, and structural data

### eCFR API Integration
The ingestion process hits these endpoints:
- Agency metadata and hierarchy
- CFR title information
- Structured JSON for navigation
- Full XML content for analysis

### Performance Considerations
- Parallel processing of multiple agencies
- Incremental updates with change detection
- Rate limiting to respect eCFR API limits
- Progress tracking and error recovery

## Security & Best Practices

### Environment Security
- Database credentials are containerized
- No sensitive data in client-side code
- API routes validate input parameters
- Prisma prevents SQL injection

### Development Best Practices
- TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- ESLint configuration for code quality
- Component-based architecture for maintainability
- Comprehensive error boundaries

## Next Steps
Once setup is complete, guide the user to:

1. **Explore Agencies**: Try different federal agencies to see data variation
2. **Cross-cutting Analysis**: Look for agencies with high regulatory overlap
3. **Complexity Patterns**: Compare complexity scores across departments
4. **Data Relationships**: Understand parent-child agency relationships
5. **API Integration**: Experiment with custom API queries
6. **Testing**: Run the full test suite and understand coverage

## Advanced Features

### Aggregation Analysis
Show how to use the sub-agency aggregation:
- Select a parent agency (e.g., Department of Transportation)
- Toggle "Include Sub-agencies" to see combined metrics
- Compare individual vs. aggregated complexity scores

### Cross-cutting Navigation
Demonstrate the interactive features:
- Click on shared agencies in cross-cutting analysis
- Follow regulatory connections between departments
- Understand regulatory collaboration patterns

### Performance Optimization
Explain the built-in optimizations:
- Database query caching for complex calculations
- Parallel API requests for better response times
- Suspense boundaries for progressive loading

## Troubleshooting Data Quality

### Validating Ingested Data
```bash
# Check data completeness
npm run test:api

# Verify specific agency data
# Use the database queries above to spot-check records
```

### Common Data Issues
- Missing XML content (API timeout)
- Incomplete agency hierarchies
- Checksum mismatches (data integrity)

## Development Ready
Confirm the user can:
- Navigate the application confidently
- Understand the regulatory analysis metrics
- Make code changes with hot reload
- Run tests and interpret results
- Access database for custom queries
- Understand the federal regulation domain
- Use the interactive features effectively

Your goal is to get them from zero to a fully functional regulatory analysis environment with confidence to explore federal deregulation patterns and contribute to the codebase!
